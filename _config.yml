  Hi there! My name is Ben. I am a recent B.S. Computer Science grad from the University of Michigan, and in July I began
  a full-time role with AT&T as a Software Engineer. My experience spans everywhere from writing fullstack web and
  mobile apps in React, NodeJS, Swift, and Python, to creating scheduled microservices in Java/Apache Camel that are used
  to consume large datasets for machine learning on att.com (my current role).

  Outside of coding, I enjoy weight lifting, running, reading, cooking, and writing/recording music. I also enjoy documenting 
  experiences like this one through film and video:

          - Contributed over 600+ lines of NodeJS code to a local development tool used by several developers 
          for "Handlebars" template syntax validation and streamlined a loading process that would ordinarily 
          take hours over the course of a single day, yielding hours of saved development/labor costs and efficiency. 
          Introduced an additional 300+ lines of code in Mocha unit testing to ensure code quality.
          - Spearheaded the creation of a new Java/Maven/Apache Camel microservice totaling over 2600+ lines of code 
          that would be used for directing terabytes worth of data over the course of its lifetime to inform customer 
          segment marketing for att.com. Incorporated an additional 1200+ lines of Mockito unit testing code, and performed 
          stress-testing to ensure stability under various data loads.
          - Proposed the practice of automated unit test generation using a tool called "EvoSuite" for a yearly innovation
          sprint and upon approval, was tasked with guiding its implementation among a team of 9 other engineers, resulting 
          in high-coverage, low-overhead test suites that required significantly less time to produce when compared alongside 
          their manually produced counterparts.
          - Served as the local Community Engagement lead and helped organize several virtual volunteering/fundraising opportunities 
          with organizations such as Feeding America and MakerGirl, achieving just over \$500 allocated towards various causes over 
          the course of my service.

          - Contributed 500+ lines of code to "Device Tracker", a React/Node.js application that would be used to 
          locate 1000+ misplaced Android devices across hundreds of Home Depot retail locations, yielding hundreds
           of thousands of dollars in savings in labor and replacement costs
          - Initiated the development "App360", a React/Node.js/MongoDB application that aimed to consolidate data 
          on hundreds of Home Depot software applications, allowing directors, managers, and associates to communicate
           more effectively across teams and reduce redundancy in overlapping projects

          - Achieved peer-to-peer food delivery iOS/Swift application in a team consisting of 3 engineers over the
           course of 12 weeks, utilizing GoogleMaps API as the primary engine behind core functionality
          - Engineered end-to-end user registration, authentication, and payment flows to establish secure and reliable
           storage of user's personal information, utilizing Google Firebase as primary data layer and Stripe API for secure transactions

          Designed and implemented a crowd-sourced Swift/Firebase iOS application that maps out various accessibility features at local businesses,
          landmarks, and other public areas for individuals with disabilities using Google Maps/Places API. Streamlined registration, login, and 
          authentication system using secure native credential option and Google/Facebook APIs.

          Led a team of 12 team members in the planning, designing, and implementation of a gamified iOS 
          application centered around discretely taking photos of opponents in elimination-style rounds. We utilized Swift, UIKit, Firebase, and Facebook/Google 
          APIs for authentication.

          Built an automated irrigation system that utilizes a resistive soil moisture sensor, a DC powered solenoid valve and an Arduino circuit board to control
          the flow of water through my personal tomato and pepper garden. Written in C++.

          <mark>Leadership:</mark> In addition to my coursework, I was heavily involved with "Michigan Hackers", a computer science student organization that seeks to foster a community 
          of students and individuals who are passionate about technology and who are eager to build many relevant technical and social skills not commonly taught
          inside the classroom. During my time with organization, I served as the Project Manager for the iOS core team and later as the President of the organization.
          My time with organization offered many valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and mentorship. I currently serve as a Senior Advisor for the organization.
