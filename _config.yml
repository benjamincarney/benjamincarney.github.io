  Hi there! My name is Ben. I currently work at NVIDIA as a Systems Software Engineer. My experience spans everywhere from writing fullstack web and
  mobile apps in React, NodeJS, Swift, and Python, to developing onboard vehicle software for autonomous vehicles (my current role).
  I created this website as a way to showcase my past experience and various projects that I've worked on.

          - Executed and implemented a complete front-end redesign in React for a data collection tool used among a fleet of 100+ vehicles. 
          Introduced 2000+ lines of new TypeScript code and thorough Jest unit testing to achieve high code coverage. Added several hundred
          lines of Node.js back-end code for an API used to create, update, and search heartbeat records
          - Implemented a suite of automated Jenkins integration tests in Python which was used to catch regressions in a map conversion tool 
          that was heavily utilized and depended upon by several cross-functional teams

          - Introduced 1000+ lines of code for several new metrics API endpoints and 500+ lines of accompanying JUnit testing code for 
          tracking the performance of an important estimation algorithm. Created an Apache Superset dashboard to visualize the performance 
          of the algorithm and identify unexpected regressions
          - Contributed several new features such as an incident reporting workflow to a React/Node.js tool which was run inside a fleet 
          of 15+ data collection vehicles and used by several different operators

          - Contributed over 600+ lines of Node.js code to a local development tool used by several developers 
          for syntax validation and streamlined a loading process that would ordinarily 
          take hours over the course of a single day, yielding hours of saved development/labor costs and efficiency. 
          Introduced an additional 300+ lines of code in Mocha unit testing to ensure code quality.
          - Spearheaded the creation of a new Java/Maven/Apache Camel microservice totaling over 2600+ lines of code 
          that would be used for directing terabytes worth of data over the course of its lifetime to inform marketing 
          campaigns for att.com. Incorporated an additional 1200+ lines of Mockito unit testing code, and performed 
          stress-testing to ensure stability under various data loads
          - Proposed the practice of automated unit test generation using a tool called "EvoSuite" for a yearly innovation
          sprint and upon approval, was tasked with guiding its implementation among a team of 9 other engineers, resulting 
          in high-coverage, low-overhead test suites that required significantly less time to produce when compared alongside 
          their manually produced counterparts
          - Served as the local Community Engagement lead and helped organize several virtual volunteering/fundraising opportunities 
          with organizations such as Feeding America and MakerGirl, achieving just over \$500 allocated towards various causes over 
          the course of my service

          - Contributed 500+ lines of code to "Device Tracker", a React/Node.js application that would be used to 
          locate 1000+ misplaced Android devices across hundreds of Home Depot retail locations, yielding hundreds
           of thousands of dollars in savings in labor and replacement costs
          - Initiated the development "App360", a React/Node.js/MongoDB application that aimed to consolidate data 
          on hundreds of Home Depot software applications, allowing directors, managers, and associates to communicate
           more effectively across teams and reduce redundancy in overlapping projects

          Led a team of 12 team members in the planning, designing, and implementation of a gamified iOS 
          application centered around discretely taking photos of opponents in elimination-style rounds. We utilized Swift, UIKit, Firebase, and Facebook/Google 
          APIs for authentication.
